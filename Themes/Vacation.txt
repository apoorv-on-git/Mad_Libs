VACATIONS
A vacation is when you take a trip to some ADJECTIVE1 place with your ADJECTIVE2 family. Usually you go to some place that is near a/an NOUN1 or up on a/an NOUN2 . A good vacation place is one where you can ride PLURAL_NOUN1 or play GAME1 or go hunting for PLURAL_NOUN2 . I like to spend my time VERB1 or VERB2 . When parents go on a vacation, they spend their time eating three PLURAL_NOUN3 a day, and fathers play golf, and mothers sit around VERB3 . Last summer, my little brother fell in a/an NOUN3 and got poison PLANT1 all over his PART_OF_THE_BODY1 . My family is going to go to (the) PLACE1 , and I will practice VERB4 . Parents need vacations more than kids because parents are always very ADJECTIVE3 and because they have to work NUMBER1 hours every day all year making enough PLURAL_NOUN4 to pay for the vacation.
