My Trip to Disney World!
Last month, I went to Disney World with NAME1 . We traveled for NUMBER1 by car. Finally, we got there and it was very ADJECTIVE1 . There were ADJECTIVE2 people VERB1 everywhere. There were also people dressed up in ANIMAL1 costumes. I wish it had been more ADJECTIVE3 , but we VERB2 anyway. We also went on some ADJECTIVE4 rides, called "Magic NOUN1 ". Friend's name nearly fell off a ride and had to be VERB3 . Later we went to the hotel and VERB4 . Next year, I want to go to PLACE1 , where we can VERB5 .
