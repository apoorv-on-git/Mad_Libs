The Monkey King!
The day I saw the Monkey King VERB1 . It was one of the most interesting days of the year. I still cannot believe my PART_OF_THE_BODY1 . I have the excitement running through my body for over a week. The Money King VERB2 one of the largest FRUIT1 I had seen in TIME1 . The funniest thing was when he pushed Ms. Susan in a huge pile of Soccer Balls. After he did that, the king played chess on his brother's NOUN1 and then combed his ADJECTIVE1 hair with a comb made out of old fish bones. Later, that same day, I saw the Monkey King dance ADVERB1 in front of an audience of kangaroos and wombats.
