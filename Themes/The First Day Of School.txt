The First Day of School
One beautiful summer morning NAME1 woke me up at 7:00am. It was just near the end of the summer and I was trying to catch up on my sleep. NAME2 said “Wake up FOOD1 ! It’s the first day of school! Let’s get going because my new teacher Ms. Susan is really an animal. I can’t wait to throw FOOD2 at her. I hear she can’t resist VERB1 it with her teeth!” I moaned and groaned for TIME1 , but eventually, I woke and starter getting dressed. I wore a COLOR1 CLOTHES1 with a very long NOUN1 attached to it. My shoes rocked hard! They were covered in dirt from the night before. I flipped over the shoe and yelled "EXCLAIMATION1 " I grabbed a spoon and had breakfast off of my shoes! NUMBER1 hours later, the bus came, and in few minutes I was already at school. In school, I met two really ADJECTIVE1 kids. All of us became friends very fast. That day we had science, and luckily my friends and I were at the same NOUN2 . My friends' names are NOUN3 and NOUN4 . At math, we weren't together, and that really bugged me. We learned what PLURAL_NOUN1 were, and when to use them. At snack and recess, we played 'Three - Square' together. It was extremely fun. At Physical Education class, we were VERB2 off of the ropes onto PLURAL_NOUN2 . I thought it was a very ADJECTIVE2 idea. In swimming class, we needed to swim extremely ADVERB1 , or else...we would get tortured. An hour went by and I gathered all my stuff and threw it in my back pack. The bus came screeching into the parking lot. Just before I got onto the bus, like a bull horn; I shouted, "Goodbye, adios amigos, sayonara, and shalom," to my friends. In a flash the bus raced us home and the day had concluded! What a great day!
